# 🥴 Three (are.na) Blocks A Day
a web app that serves up three random blocks from your are.na profile.<br>
a [readwise](https://readwise.io/) for are.na blocks, if you will.<br>
(three blocks a day keeps the doctor away...?)

### 🛠 things to do
- <b>BACKEND</b>
  * Refactor code
  * Figure out way to do check without creating test data
- <b>FRONTEND</b>
  * refresh should give you three new blocks
  * depending on block class, create type-specific components
- <b>SOME DAY...</b>
