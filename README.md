# 🔁 re.are.na
A web app that serves up three random blocks from your are.na profile.<br>
A [readwise](https://readwise.io/) for are.na blocks, if you will.<br>
(three blocks a day keeps the doctor away...?)

### 🛠 things to do
  * Refactor code
  * Figure out way to do check without creating test data
  * Functionality:
    + connect backend to frontend
    + set up refresh button
  * refresh == three new blocks
  * convert this to have this be a daily email as opposed to a web app
